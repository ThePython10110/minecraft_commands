# Better Commands
The goal of this mod is to add Minecraft command syntax (such as `/kill @e[type=mobs_mc:zombie, distance = 2..]`[/icode]`) to Minetest.

Note: This mod work weirdly if there are registered items with the itemstring `e`, `a`, `s`, `r`, or `p`. `modname:e` is fine, just not `e` by itself. This applies to aliases as well.

Players with names that match itemstrings might not work.
